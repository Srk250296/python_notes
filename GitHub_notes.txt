
Github:
-------
- Github is centralized code hosting platform. It offers both distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git.
- Also facilitates with many of its features, such as access control and collabaration.
- VCS (Version Control System)
- SCM (Source Code Management)

Ex: VCS
Gmail 1.0: registration, login, inbox
Gmail 2.0 : registration, login, inbox, Sent items, drafts, primary
Gmail 3.0 : registration, login, inbox, Sent items, drafts, primary, google meet

Gmail 2.0: registration, login, inbox, Sent items, drafts, primary


What is repository:
-------------------
- Repositories in GIT contain a collection of files of various different versions of a Project.
- Represents a project

what is a branch:
------------------
specific to some task

master branch:
---------------
- main branch having finalized code for a project.
- all features will be merged to master branch

Feature branch:
---------------
- Specific to one task, 
- once code implementation is completed we can raise a Pull Request to merge our feature branch to master
- 

Pull Request:
-------------
Raise a request To merge our code from one feature to another feature

Merge Request:
--------------
- accepting code pulll request from a feature branch to our branch 
- Accepting the changes
- Before merging we need to review the changes, if those all fine, then only we can merge.
- If there any changes required we can write a review message and close the PR(Pull Request). That means PR is rejected.


what is merge conflict:
-----------------------

- IF we suppose to see multiple pull request from multiple feature branches, 
  for the same file and the same line having different code usage in different branches, then it will be a merge conflict.

- We can't merge the code from feature to master directly if we have merge conflicts, 
  first we need to resolve those conflicts and can able to merge.
  
- We can resolve these merge conflicts by clicking on resolve conflicts and review & modify the changes 
  i.e which changes are required are kept alone and remove the unwanted changes. And click on commit.

- Now we can able to merge the code from feature.
